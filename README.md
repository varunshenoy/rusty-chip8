# A *Rusty* CHIP-8 Emulator

### 🌊🌊🌊🌊 🏝️ 🦀 🦀 🦀 🏝️

(currently a WIP)

I first wanted to build a GBA emulator, since I've grown up on those, but it seems like a lot for a first-time emulator (and honestly, implementing [every single instruction](https://meganesulli.com/generate-gb-opcodes/) would take forever). I'm also completely new to Rust, so building a CHIP-8 emulator seems like a good place to start. Overall, this is a fantastic systems project to learn a new language (and have somethign to show at the end of it all).

### Todos:
- [ ] incorporate opcodes
- [ ] add key bindings
- [ ] add graphics

### Resources Used:
- [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#1.0)
- [Colin Eberhardt's WASM Rust Chip-8 Outut](https://colineberhardt.github.io/wasm-rust-chip8/web/) 
    *this one helped me make sure my emulator was reading and parsing bits correctly*
