> CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine.

I first wanted to build a GBA emulator, since I've grown up on those, but it seems like a lot for a first-time emulator (and honestly, implementing [every single instruction](https://meganesulli.com/generate-gb-opcodes/) would take forever). I'm also completely new to Rust, so building a CHIP-8 emulator seems like a good place to start. Overall, this is a fantastic systems project to learn a new language (and have something to show at the end of it all).

I primarily tested this emulator on TETRIS and PONG, so try those for the best experience.

Note that it seems like the key debouncer within `minifb` is not the best, so sometimes keys may not be received properly. This is a first time Rust and "building an emulator" project I've done, so expect some quirks.

    *this one helped me make sure my emulator was reading and parsing bits correctly*
