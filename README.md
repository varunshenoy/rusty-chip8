# A CHIP-8 Emulator 
## written in Rust 🦀

(currently a WIP)
<!-- 
I first wanted to build a GBA emulator, since I've grown up on those, but it seems like a lot for a first-time emulator (and honestly, implementing [every single instruction](https://meganesulli.com/generate-gb-opcodes/) would take forever). I'm also completely new to Rust, so building a CHIP-8 emulator seems like a good place to start. Overall, this is a fantastic systems project to learn a new language (and have somethign to show at the end of it all). -->

### Todos:
- [] incorporate opcodes
- [] add key bindings
- [] add graphics
 
### Resources Used:
- [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#1.0)
