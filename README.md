# A CHIP-8 Emulator Written in Rust

(currently a WIP)

I first wanted to build a GBA emulator, since I've grown up on those, but it seems like a lot for a first-time emulator. I'm also completely new to Rust, so building a CHIP-8 emulator seems like a good place to start.

### Resources Used:
- [Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#1.0)
- [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
